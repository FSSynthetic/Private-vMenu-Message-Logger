# Private-vMenu-Message-Logger
This is a simple server sided Lua script that logs all private vMenu sent messages to a Discord channel of your choice.

The only thing you have to do is place the webhook URL of the channel you want it to log to.
It's quite a simple script so there's not much explanation required in my opinion.
